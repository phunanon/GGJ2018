# TODO

## Must do
- Fix sprite overlapping in display
- Sprite/Entity enums used exclusively over numbers
- Improve collision detection so Entities can't pass through gaps between Sprites
- Create proper Makefile and Headers
-- Try raycasting:
- Ensure Entities don't try to attack/shoot through solid sprites
- Replace bias findEntity(), perhaps with fast-think random tile

## Should do
- test protag random gun accuracy
- background music
- Zombie bite animation
- Write CREDITS.md
- Blood animation when attacked by zombie
- Enable protag zombie mode
- Fix Villager animations looking backwards at certain angles
- Mouse crosshair
- Improve crate sprite

## Could do
- Animated foliage
- Protag torch
- Fog
- Crate destruction
- Stop shooting/movement unless mouse is in window
- Add granade which can be thrown over Sprites
- Comb through code and conform to syntax style
- More variation in sounds
- Change protag indicator to above-head arrow
- Pause
- Zombies start in one part of the map and spread, protag near this
- Slide instead of stop on Entity/Sprite collision
